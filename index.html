    <main>  I love to cook and play with my dogs during my free time. 
        I currently work at navico group as a Technology Generalist,
         which basically means I look at excel spreadsheets all day, or I jump around to whichever project needs an extra set of hands. 
          <p> I've been coding since I was in high school, and I've done little things here and there like creating mods for my favorite games,
             or trying to fix whatever software issues I for some reason constantly face no matter what I am doing. this is actually what led me to 
             want to be in the software development field, because if I am constantly going to be instance one of an error I might as well be the one to try to figure it out.
            I am currently attending fvtc for the software development degree but will also be staying to complete a second degree in Web Development and Design.
